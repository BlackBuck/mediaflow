# MediaFlow: A Realistic 4-Week Development Roadmap (Go Backend)
This plan focuses on building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) locally using Go for the backend. By the end of this month, you will have a working, high-performance application that can process video files asynchronously.

## Week 1: The Core Backend (No UI Yet)
Goal: Create a simple Go API that can accept a video file and run an ffmpeg command on it. We will test this using a tool like Postman or Insomnia, not a web browser.

### Days 1-2: Setup & "Hello World"

Initialize a new Go module (go mod init mediaflow).

Install Gin Gonic, a popular web framework (go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin).

Create a basic Gin server that listens on a port (e.g., 8080).

Create a simple /health endpoint that returns { "status": "ok" } to confirm the server is running.

### Days 3-4: Handling File Uploads

Create a new POST endpoint, e.g., /api/upload.

In your handler, use Gin's built-in methods (c.FormFile() and c.SaveUploadedFile()) to save the uploaded file to a local directory (e.g., ./uploads).

Use Postman to send a video file to this endpoint and verify that it appears in your ./uploads folder.

### Days 5-7: First ffmpeg Integration (The "Slow" Way)

Create a new POST endpoint, e.g., /api/extract-audio.

This endpoint will use Go's built-in os/exec package to run an ffmpeg command.

The command will take an input video from the ./uploads folder and create an MP3 file in a ./processed folder.

Crucially, do this synchronously (cmd.Run()). The API request will hang until ffmpeg is finished. You need to feel this pain to appreciate why a job queue is necessary.

At the end of the week, you can successfully send a video to an endpoint and get an audio file, even if it's slow. This is a huge milestone.

## Week 2: Asynchronous Architecture with a Job Queue
Goal: Offload the slow ffmpeg task to a background process so the API is instantly responsive. This is the most impressive part of the architecture.

### Days 8-9: Dockerize Everything

Create a Dockerfile for your Go application (use a multi-stage build for a tiny final image).

Create a docker-compose.yml file. This file will define two services:

app: Your compiled Go server.

redis: The in-memory database for our job queue.

Get your app from Week 1 running successfully using docker-compose up.

### Days 10-11: Introducing the Job Queue

Install Asynq, a popular job queue library for Go (go get -u github.com/hibiken/asynq).

Refactor the /api/extract-audio endpoint. Instead of running ffmpeg directly, it will now:

Create an Asynq client that connects to the Redis service.

Enqueue a new task (e.g., named "task:extract_audio"). The task payload will contain the filename of the uploaded video.

Immediately return a response to the user, like { "message": "Your file is being processed", "taskId": ... }. The API is now fast!

### Days 12-14: Building the Worker

Create a new Go program in a separate folder (e.g., ./worker/main.go).

This worker will create an Asynq server. Its only job is to listen for new tasks on the queue.

Write a handler function that receives the "task:extract_audio" task and executes the ffmpeg command from Week 1.

Add a third service to your docker-compose.yml called worker, which runs your compiled Go worker.

Now you have a complete, asynchronous processing pipeline!

## Week 3: Building the User Interface
Goal: Create a simple React frontend so a real user can interact with your application.

Days 15-16: React Setup

Use Vite to create a new React project (npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react).

Create a simple file upload component with an <input type="file" /> and a button.

### Days 17-19: Connecting Frontend to Backend

Install axios for making API requests.

When the user clicks the button, upload the selected file to your /api/upload endpoint.

After the upload is successful, make a call to the /api/extract-audio endpoint.

Show a message to the user: "Your file has been submitted for processing!"

### Days 20-21: Job Status & Download

Create a new backend endpoint: GET /api/task-status/:taskId. This endpoint will use the Asynq inspector to check the status of a task.

On the frontend, after submitting a task, use setInterval to "poll" this status endpoint every 3 seconds.

When the task is complete, display a download link for the user.

Create a final backend endpoint GET /api/download/:fileName to serve the processed file from the ./processed directory.

## Week 4: Polish and a New Feature
Goal: Improve the user experience and prove the architecture is extensible by adding a second ffmpeg feature.

### Days 22-24: UI/UX Improvements

Add a library like Tailwind CSS to make the UI look clean and modern.

Implement an upload progress bar.

Display the task status dynamically on the page (e.g., "Processing...", "Complete!").

Handle and display errors from the backend if a task fails.

### Days 25-28: Add the "Create GIF" Feature

Frontend: Add new UI elements to the form (e.g., inputs for start time and end time).

Backend API: Create a new endpoint, /api/create-gif. This will enqueue a new task with a different type (e.g., "task:create_gif").

Worker: Modify your Go worker. Use an Asynq ServeMux to register different handler functions for different task types. One handler for "task:extract_audio", and a new one for "task:create_gif".

This demonstrates that your system is now a flexible toolbox, not a one-trick pony.

Beyond the First Month
By following this plan, you'll have a fantastic project. The next steps would be to replace local file storage with a free-tier cloud service like AWS S3 and deploy it, but you'll have a solid, working, and impressive foundation first. Good luck!
